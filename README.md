## Knapsack Problem Solver

This C++ program provides two different approaches, Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS), to solve the classic Knapsack Problem. The Knapsack Problem involves selecting a combination of items from a given set to maximize the total benefit, considering a maximum weight constraint.

## Greedy Best-First Search for Route Planning

This C++ program implements the Greedy Best-First Search algorithm for finding the optimal route between two cities using heuristic information. The program reads city data, including straight-line distances to the destination city, and connection data (distances between cities) from input files. It then applies the Greedy Best-First Search algorithm to find the most efficient route from the start city "Malaga" to the goal city "Valladolid."

## Sudoku Solver

his C++ program provides a simple Sudoku solver that can solve Sudoku puzzles. It reads a set of Sudoku puzzles from the "sudoku_data.txt" file, attempts to solve each puzzle using a recursive backtracking algorithm, and then prints the solved puzzles or indicates if no solution exists.

## Traveling Salesman Problem Solver using Genetic Algorithm

This C++ program provides a solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The TSP involves finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city, minimizing the total distance traveled.
